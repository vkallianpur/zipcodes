Restful API and a client

What i want to do is
--API--
-Host the API using ngrok or AWS or Azure so users can invoke the API themselves
-Document the APIs using Swagger or similar
-Provide a POSTMAN script to load/test the APIs
-Unit test the APIs
-Make the APIs secure using OAuth..no need to actually implement the OAuth server

--Client--
-Host the client using ngrok or AWS or Azure so users can test the functionality themselves..maybe Swagger UI is sufficient or show full stack skills
-Client doesnt have to be UI based
-Make the client secure so users need to login or provide a token

--General--
-Use best practices, conventions, documentation
-Exception handling
-input Validation
-use github

--Technologies--
API - NodeJS or ASP.NET ...NodeJs I can demonstrate new language skills and its an interpreted language
Client - Angular or ASP.NET MVC...can demonstrate MVC, Razor, JS 

--Questions--
In a real world with limited resources you need to prioritize so what are you looking for in this exercise
Does the Ruby application need to be UI based 
All code that you produced uploaded to this repo => Which repo? its not specified
The first file below will allow you to map a zip code to a CBSA  => looks like a zip code can map to multiple CBSAs. should it pick one (which?) or process each one and return collective results?
If the CBSA is 99999, the zip code is not part of a CBSA => I assume that mean no further processing is necessary
You should assume that the data import will need to happen again sometime in the future as the population numbers get updated. => will only the population numbers be updated? no additional columns for subsequent years data?
